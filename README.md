# landing-page
2nd try on making the landing page better, a cleaner code; flexbox implemented a bit better than the previous one.

I have now re-made the landing page. I understand the concept of Flexbox a lot more now (far from being an expert though), I no longer
play with abusive widths, I just let flex to take care of the responsive design whenever the window gets minimised.

I have a long way ahead of me to improve though!
